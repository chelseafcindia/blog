In the recently concluded transfer window, former Leicester midfielder, joined Chelsea FC on the last day just before the window closed. The move reunites Drinkwater with N'Golo Kante, who he formed an irresistible partnership with as the Foxes won the Premier League in 2015-16.

He is a former Manchester United academy graduate, and joined Chelsea as their 6th signing this season. The England international made 218 appearances for the Foxes, helping them lift the Championship and Premier League titles during his time. The Englishman has been a sturdy defensive midfielder amidst all Leicester's attacking quality, acting as a shield in front of back four. Drinkwater’s discipline has allowed the Foxes to play their attacking brand of football without worrying about being exposed on the counter. Reuniting with N’Golo at Chelsea, may indicate something similar of what happened back in 2015-16 season, and the blues fans are really hopeful with this transfer. Antonio Conte, has always been known for his signings who aren’t exactly superstar names, and DannyDrinkwater is exactly the type of “Antonio Conte’s Player”. Hard work is what defines this former fox, and his inclusion is a major boost in the central midfield area for Chelsea FC, as they have to play a notable number of matches this season, with them back in UEFA Champions League. Here’s hoping for a great season for Danny and Chelsea both, and looking forward of watching him in a Blue’s Jersey soon! \
