The Champions of England returns to the grandest stage of the European Competitions after a year of absence because of miserable 2015-16 season.

The Blues have been handed a tricky group as they are paired with the last year semi finalists Atletico Madrid, Italian Giants AS Roma and this year’s debutants Qarabag.

Chelsea last played Atletico Madrid in the 2014 semi-finals where the blues fell short and were eliminated. The Bitter rivalry of these two clubs will be put to a test again.

Atleti’s Quick and Worldclass attackers like Griezmann and Carrasco will be a tough task for Defence whereas our attackers will have to break through the wall of Godin and a very familiar face Filipe Luis.

A trip to Stadio Olimpico will prove to be a crucial affair as we will be facing the Italian side in consecutive matchdays 3 & 4. The midfield of Nainggolan and De Rossi will be tough to break. Recent visits to Italy have not been good for us, our boys will look to do better this time on the Italian soil.

**Everyone expects us to take all 6 points against Qarabag but in Football we all know anything can happen. We need to workhard and focus for every game because taking any team for granted can anytime prove to be a costly mistake .There will also be a challenge to maintain the shape and fitness as we travel to Baku which is a long travel with a round trip of almost 6,000 miles.**

Not just Madrid outfit is a test for Blues, the other two teams will also be a tough task as all the four teams aim to reach the next stage of the Champions League.

The European journey adds to a demanding schedule for Conte and his team who play Arsenal, City, United and Liverpool in the Premier League immediately after Champions League fixtures this season.

The return of the Champions League this month, along with a Carabao Cup fixture against Nottingham Forest means the Blues will play seven games in just three weeks. The schedule demands a regular rotation of the squad which means the new signings and the young superstars like Musonda and Christensen will get chances to show their worth.

C - Group

C – Chelsea

C – Conte

C – Champions? only the time will tell this.

The group is tough we all know that. But we also know that The Blues Never Give Up. ;)
