This game would be more emotional for Chelsea fans, as they would be seeing the club legend and ex captain sitting at opponent dugout. Frank Lampard who was our vice-captain, will be re united with his ex-teammate John Terry.

# Predicted XI

Chelsea are expected to play in 4-2-3-1 formation against Villa. The midfield will be the focal point of Chelsea’s press and build up play against a good counter attacking opposition. This is the team we can expect for the game:

# Memories at Villa Park

## Aston Villa 1-2 Chelsea, May 11, 2013

This game would be a memorable one for all Chelsea fans in the globe. The Blues went 1 down and were down by a man before HT. During the 2nd half, our gaffer Lampard scored both the goals which not only secured us 3 points, but also made Frank Lampard Chelsea top scorer.

## Aston Villa 0-1 Chelsea, Feb 21, 2009

Chelsea secured a had fought win against Aston Villa with Nicholas Anelka scoring the only goal of the game. This was our 1st win at Villa Park since 1999, and this win was crucial for Guus Hiddink side.

My prediction for the final score is Villa 0-2 Chelsea with the blues dominating the possession.

> Keep the Blue Flag Flying High...!!!
