Lampard’s side play their first game at Stamford Bridge this season, against the defending Champions Liverpool. From his latest press conference, it was confirmed that Ziyech, Chilwell, Silva and Pulisic will be out and it will be tough and challenging for Frank Lampard in this game.

Thiago Silva has a full week of training under his belt but it's unclear whether he is ready for his Chelsea debut just yet. With Ben Chilwell still side lined, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Cesar Azpilicueta come in at left-back in favour of Marcos Alonso on Sunday. Mateo Kovacic is back from his suspension and may slot into midfield at the expense of Jorginho, who looked to be struggling at the end of last week's 3-1 win over Brighton.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek is also expected to drop out of the starting XI after a hard game in the opening weekend.
My prediction is that Lampard would prefer Giroud in the frontline and Werner on the wings, Azpi would be required if Liverpool starts Salah, to make Salah harder to cut in.
Giroud would be good to battle VVD, and Kovacic can be used to break lines well with his passing with a tricky fixture ahead, Lampard would try for something better this game as compared to previous games.

# Chelsea’s Predicted XI

Chelsea are expected to play in a 4-3-2-1 formation against the Merseyside. Knowing the attacking capabilities of the opponent, Lampard would surely try to play out the game with a disciplined defending at the back and the mid. This is the team we can expect for tonight’s match:

Subs: Caba, Christensen, Alonso, Barkley, Abraham, CHO, RLC

# Players to Watch Out

## Reece James

One of the academy products introduced by Frank Lampard, was crucial in our previous season. With a splendid goal from outside the box and assist from the corner for Zouma in our opening game, it’s clear that Reece would be much needed for the game.

## Kai Havertz

New signing would be playing at Number 10 and would be crucial to provide support to our attack. A much-needed signing for the club, and fans would be expecting more from him.

## Timo Werner

Another new signing, fans will be expecting more goals from him. He can also play in LW, and playing with Giroud/Abraham would be different and challenging for him.

## Mason Mount

Another academy product, and favourite to Frank Lampard, who is versatile. He can be played in multiple attacking positions. He can play at RW/CM/LW and will be having competition in this season in those positions.

## Kovacic

After returning from suspension, and being the best player last season, fans would be expecting him to dominate the midfield yet again. A person who can control in the mid, would be a huge asset for the club.

# Key Stats

**Chelsea have not lost at Stamford Bridge to the reigning Premier League champions for 18 years.**

Jorginho’s goal in the opening game made it 16 successes from the spot in a row for the Blues in the top-flight. The last penalty failure was by Hazard in the 2-1 win against Manchester City on 5 April 2017, and the man who saved it was none other than one of our present keepers, Willy Caballero.

Despite winless against Liverpool in last 2 PL games at Home, the last game against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge was won by Chelsea 2-0 in FA Cup.

# Memories Against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge

## Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, May 2018

Chelsea secured their much-needed win against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in May 2018. Giroud was our scorer for that game.

## Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool, May 2003

It was titled as the £20 million shootout and the chance to compete at Europe’s top table. Chelsea and Liverpool FC went head-to-head on the final day of the 2002-2003 season in effectively a direct play-off. Gronkjaer netted a 26th minute winner, which was enough for the Blues to secure the CL spot.

# Gaffer Against Liverpool

Despite as a manager having a moderate H2H record vs Liverpool last season, as a player he enjoyed scoring against them. He has scored 7 goals against Liverpool in all competitions and here are the few memorable ones:

## Chelsea 3-2 Liverpool, May 2008

![Lampard.jpg](/uploads/Lampard.jpg)

Chelsea secured their first CL win against Liverpool in May 2008, which helped them to reach the CL finals. Our gaffer was on the scoresheet as the goal meant a lot for him which was dedicated to his mother who passed away few days before the match. Drogba netted brace in the game.

## Chelsea 4-4 Liverpool , April 2009

After having comfortable lead in the 1st leg at Anfield, 1-3, Chelsea still had much more to do at Stamford Bridge, as they conceded 2 early goal. Frank Lampard who captained ahead of suspended John Terry, scored 2 crucial goals to give a cushion for the Blues.
