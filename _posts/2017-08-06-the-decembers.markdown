December is one of the most important months in the EPL title race. A jam packed schedule with League, Cup and European fixtures, add to that festive mood and the cherry on the cake – those cold-wet evenings! No doubt the “winter curse” sends a chill down spines – especially if you’re a Blues fan.

So let’s have a flashback on Chelsea’s league performance in the last 5 years during this period.

**2009-10 Season**

*The Double Winning Season*\
Games played :- 6\
Points:- 9 (W2 D3 L1)\
GD:- \+1
\
Ancelotti’s men had a pretty decent December time in our winning campaign. The big fixtures included
\
an away trip to Etihad where we lost 3 points and then a home game against Everton which saw an
\
entertaining 3-3 draw. We ended our year perfectly defeating rivals Fulham in the West London Derby.
\\

\
\*\*2010-11 Season
\*\*\
Games played :- 4
\
Points:- 5 (W1 D2 L1)
\
GD:- -1
\
After winning the previous season, lot was expected fromThe Pensioners this season. The season had its
\
own ups and downs and we eventually finished 2 nd , 9 pts behind winners Manchester United. December
\
dint go as Ancelotti would have wanted as the team got just 1 point from 2 London Derbies, drew away
\
against Spurs and lost away to Arsenal. Our campaign ended on a good note which saw us defeat Bolton
\
1-0 at the Bridge. The highlight of that season of course was the signing of Fernando Torres in the
\
January transfer window. King Carlo was eventually sacked on 22 nd May, 2011 after a 1-0 defeat at
\
Everton.

\*\*\
2011-12 Season
\*\*\
Games Played:-6
\
Points:-9 (W2 D3 L1)
\
GD:-\+2
\
2011-12 Season will forever be remembered by Chelsea fans. We won our 1 st ever Champions League.
\
But we dint have the same luck regarding to league as we finished a Decade low 6 th rank. Comparing to
\
the entire season, our December fixtures were much better which saw us score 9 points from a possible
\
18\. The last fixture of the year saw a shock 1-3 defeat away to Aston Villa.

\
\*\*2012-13 Season
\*\*\
Games Played:-5
\
Points:-12(W4 D0 L1)
\
GD:-\+10
\
After the sacking of Champions League winning manager Roberto Di Matteo, former Liverpool manager
\
Rafael Benitez took over on 21 st November. After a bad start we had a string of good fixtures in
\
December which saw us finish 3 rd in the league. After losing to West Ham in the start of the month, we
\
won all 12 pts from the remaining 4 fixtures which included our season best score of 8-0 against Aston
\
Villa.

\
\*\*2013-14 Season
\*\*\
Games Played:-7
\
Points:-16(W5 D1 L1)
\
GD:-\+5
\
This season saw the return of The Special One, or rather – The Happy One. In December, we got 16
\
points out the possible 21. But that din prove to be enough as we once again finished 3 rd . The Big match
\
included a trip to our London rivals Arsenal in which we could salvage just one point, a cold windy night
\
at Stoke once again haunted us as we gave away a 2-1 lead in stoppage time to lose 2-3 and hosted arch
\
rivals Liverpool which saw Eden Hazard score the winning goal to end the score 2-1.
\
December fixtures are always important for any team’s title aspirations. This season we have lost just 1
\
game and that has kept us at the top since the start of the league. Jose Mourinho would be expecting
\
similar performances from the team as we look to win our 4 th League title and 3 rd under The Special One.

\*\*2014-15 Season
\
\*\*Winter Fixtures so far:
\
Chelsea 3-0 Spurs
\
Newcastle United 2-1 Chelsea
\
Chelsea 2-0 Hull City
\
Stoke City 0-2 Chelsea
\\

\
Remaining fixtures
\
Chelsea vs West Ham (26th)
\
Southampton vs Chelsea (28th)

\
It’s all looking promising for us so far! Watch out this space for pre-match build-up and post match
\
tactical analysis.
\
Merry Christmas and a Happy Blue New Year!!
