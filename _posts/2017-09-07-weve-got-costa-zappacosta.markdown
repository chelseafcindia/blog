On the deadline day of the transfer window, a relatively lesser known entity arrived at the home of English champions, Davide Zappacosta. A fullback by position and a hardworking person by nature, the Sora-born Italian is surely an Antonio Conte type of a player.

Chelsea are obviously not new to acquiring Italian personnel including players and managers and as the history suggests, Italians have had fantastic time at the Bridge. Davide joins the illustrious list of his fellow countrymen including the likes of Zola, di Matteo, Vialli, Ancelotti, Ranieri and the gaffa himself, Antonio Conte!

The summer transfer window was all about filling the void created by outgoing players and there were a few positions on pitch for which we needed the cover. This Italian powerhouse can very well provide competition for the right wingback spot in Conte’s 3-4-3 (or 3-5-2) and will fight for his place along with Victor Moses.

The major strengths about Zappacosta’s game include strong tackles, ball winning while closing down the opponent and being a natural defender, his positional sense while defending will help the team on the flanks. One major aspect of our new boy’s game is crossing! Alvaro Morata has already scored a couple of headed goals and if he gets the proper delivery from Davide, well, all the best premier league defenders and goalkeepers!

It was our boss himself who gave him his Italian national team debut so the player is not new to the manager, which always is a good sign when you move to big league and indeed a new country. Davide has recently been recalled by national team coach which is surely a good sign for his development on bigger level and possibly, fighting for the place in FIFA World Cup squad.

The new number 21 is one of our 6 signings this summer, and we are all waiting for him to see in action. All the best Davide!
