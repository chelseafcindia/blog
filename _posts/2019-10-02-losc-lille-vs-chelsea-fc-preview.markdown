Chelsea who had a good weekend by defeating Brighton 2-0 will look to continue their winning run. Frank Lampard who as a player for Chelsea, won against Valencia back in 2007 twice, and once in 2012 had a bad start by losing 1-0 at home, will now be looking to win this fixture against Lille. Chelsea have never met Lille before in an official competition and this would be their first game face to face.

### Chelsea's Current Form

Chelsea with a steady start this season, have been giving chances to youngsters, resulting in many talents being unleashed such as Tomori, Hudson-Odoi, Abraham, Mount etc. However, Pulisic who looked promising after signing for the club, hasn't been given much of game time. Frank Lampard’s side who are currently in 7th in the Premier League are just 1 point behind 4th placed Arsenal, and will back his young stars to shine away from home on Wednesday night.
