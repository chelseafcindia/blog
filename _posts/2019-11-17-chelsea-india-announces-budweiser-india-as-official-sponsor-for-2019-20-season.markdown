Budweiser is one the fastest growing brands in the country. Budweiser, an American-style lager, was introduced in 1876 when company founder Adolphus Busch set out to create the United States' first truly national beer brand â€“ brewed to be universally popular and transcend regional tastes. Each batch of Budweiser stays true to the same family recipe used by five generations of Busch family brew-masters. Budweiser is a medium-bodied, flavourful, crisp and pure beer with blended layers of premium American and European hop aromas, brewed for the perfect balance of flavour and refreshment. Budweiser is made using time-honoured methods including "kraeusening" for natural carbonation and Beechwood aging, which results in unparalleled balance and character.
