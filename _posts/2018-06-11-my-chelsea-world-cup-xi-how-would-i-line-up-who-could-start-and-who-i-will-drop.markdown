Chelsea have one of the largest contingents of a club going to the 2018 World Cup. There is a good mix of stars and future stars, key figures and fringe players. With the fourteen players Chelsea has participating, a team can be made, albeit with only three substitutes. The players fit into an unconventional 4-2-2-2 formation which could morph into a wide diamond or a regular 4-4-2 if necessary.

### Thibaut Courtois, Keeper, Belgium

Out of the two keepers going to Russia, he is the clear starter. Can he help Belgium make a dark horse run? Possibly, but Roberto Martinez is sure to do something crazy tactically that leaves Courtois exposed. On that day, the Belgian will need to play the game of his life to see his nation advance.

`Stat#1 - Courtois has kept 15 clean sheets for the blues in 35 premier league appearances this season, conceding 34 goals over the campaign`

# Defenders:

### Antonio Rudiger, Left back, Germany

Chelsea are short on fullback options to pick from out of their World Cup contingent. So Rudiger will have to move to right back. He has played the role for Germany before and Antonio Conte tried him as a more advanced right wingback over preseason. Ultimately, Rudiger will be a center back in the tournament. But Joachim Low is one of the best managers and making players work out of position and he could move Rudiger wide to accommodate a new strategy.

### Andreas Christensen, Center back, Denmark

Christensen has played as both a holding mid and a center back for Denmark. But injuries in the back line will place him in defence for the tournament. That will be a good refresher in a four man system, something Christensen will likely be involved in next season at Chelsea. He fell out of favour towards the end of the season and will need to use the tournament to build his case for starting back up.

### Gary Cahill, Center back, England

Even if Cahill does not play a single minute for England, he will be crucial to their campaign.  He is the most experienced player for the English and both players and staff will lean on him for advice as the tournament progresses. England will be using a three man back line which increases Cahill’s chances of starting. As he enters the last year of his Chelsea contract, he will need to make a splash to earn favour at Chelsea.

`Stat#2 – Cahill made 27 appearances in a possible 38 matches last season in the league, keeping 9 clean sheets in it. He had a tackle success of 72% in the season.`

### Cesar Azpilicueta, Right back, Spain

With Rudiger at left back, Azpilicueta takes the right hand side spot in a familiar way. He has not played left back since the early Antonio Conte days but it is the role in which he made his name. Curiously, Spain tested him as a center back in a back four, a style that many believed Azpilicueta could not succeed in. He did alright, and is likely to remain a right back while Dani Carvajal is injured, but he could end the tournament more centrally. A sign of things to come at Chelsea?

# Midfielders:

### N’Golo Kante, Defensive Midfielder, France

Kante is important for France despite being consistently overshadowed by the talent around him. But the Chelsea midfielder will be key to the French making a deep run in the tournament. They fell at the Euros in 2016 because they were not fully gelled together. Kante can help to foster that connection as the French look to get over the line.

### Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Central Midfielder, England

Loftus-Cheek was injured and many feared that he would not bounce back in time for the World Cup. But he returned and picked up right where he left off. He rightfully earned his English call up and could, at the very least, be a super sub. At best, he could be this World Cup’s James Rodriguez.  In the Chelsea XI, the only spot for him is in the pivot, but he would be given license to roam and shift the formation to a wide 4-4-2 diamond.

# Attackers:

### Willian, Right Winger, Brazil

Willian has burned his bridges with Antonio Conte and perhaps even Chelsea as a whole. Rumours of a replacement for him are growing in strength. Chelsea will want to get the most they can out of the Brazilian. A good World Cup for Brazil is necessary to attract buyers beyond Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United. Willian will likely start every match as Chelsea cheer for a bidding war.

### Eden Hazard, Left Winger, Belgium

Hazard is Belgium’s captain for this tournament. He will be looking to take Belgium from outside favourites to World Cup champions. It is a long shot with Roberto Martinez as manager, but it is now or never for Belgium’s golden generation. Hazard is in his prime and this tournament will be a turning point for him and Chelsea. World Cups are natural breaking points with clubs and the Blues will hope that Hazard stays on through the summer.

`Stat#3 – Hazard scored 12 goals and made 4 assists for the Blues in the league campaign last season.`

### Michy Batshuayi, Striker, Belgium

Batshuayi injury meant that it would be touch and go for him to make the World Cup squad in time. He did, though his playing time will likely be small compared to Romelu Lukaku. His future is also very much up in the air with Chelsea’s managerial situation unresolved and striker swaps rumoured. Batshuayi could come back to Chelsea next season, but the Blues will not hesitate to use any good World Cup performances to shop him out.

### Olivier Giroud, Striker, France

France’s greatest strength is that they have several attacking systems and options, all of which are viable. 4-3-3, 4-3-2-1, and 4-4-2 and all their variants are all very much possible. Giroud is likely to get a decent amount of playing time due to the uniqueness of his style among the French. France have a strong case for winning the whole thing and Chelsea will look forward to Giroud returning if his team can pull it off.

`Stat#4 – Giroud has scored 7 goals last season out of which 4 of them were headers. And the 31-year-old has been very prolific for his country with 31 goals in 72 caps, this makes him the fifth highest goal scorer for France.`

# Substitutes:

### Willy Caballero, Substitute, Argentina

Argentina are relatively weak at goalkeeper. Their options basically amount to backups and big clubs or starters in lower leagues. Caballero is likely to start in the tournament now, but the position is up in the air depending on how things go. Like Belgium, it is now or never for the Lionel Messi generation. Caballero could come home a World Cup winner or be part of yet another Argentine team with great promise but no silverware.

### Victor Moses, Substitute, Nigeria

Moses plays in the wider, more attacking midfield positions for Nigeria. Wing back is where he returned to Chelsea fame, but winger is where he made his name. Moses needs to do well at the World Cup with his wing back days likely being over. At winger, he will face far more competition at Chelsea. Doing well in the tournament can earn him a spot in Blue or earn him the attention of potential buyers.

### Kenneth Omeruo, Substitute, Nigeria

Omeruo looked incredible in the 2014 World Cup. Then he suffered a series of injuries and he fell off of Chelsea’s radar. He has spent the last several seasons on loan in Turkey and could very well be sold before the summer ends. But for now, he is a Chelsea player in a strong Nigerian team. Nigeria has some upsets in them and they will be looking to spoil Argentina’s fun.
