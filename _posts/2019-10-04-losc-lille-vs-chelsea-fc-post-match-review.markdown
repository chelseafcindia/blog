The Blues manage to pick up the first 3 points in the UEFA Champions league fixture against the French Ligue 1 club Lille. After an unfortunate defeat against Valencia at home it was a crucial game to get the Champions league run back on track.

The boys started off well and controlled the opening 10 minutes of the game. The build-up play from the back looked promising and we had few chances at the start of the game. It was great to have Kante back at the squad as he lifted the morale of the players and added defensive stability at the back. We were moving the ball nice and quick and the passing was at the top level. This resulted in giving us the 1st goal from our homegrown beast “Tammy Abraham” from a beautiful lofted pass by Tomori who happens to be another gem of our Chelsea academy. The finishing was top class and it also marked his 1st goal in any European tournament which surely was a moment to remember for him on his special day.

Shortly after the goal Lille started to press our defence hard and tried to break us on the counter. The defence looked shaky at times. Kepa did amazingly well for us last night as he made some crucial saves and was at the top gear the whole time.

Lille threw waves of attack to our defence which forced us to concede a corner. The blues have been very vulnerable in defending set pieces this season and yesterday was another evidence of that when Benjamin Andre’s header gave Lille the equaliser at 33rd minute. The rest of the 1st half was being largely dominated by Lille who had a very disciplined 4-2-3-1 formation as a whole.

Being up ahead at 22nd minute it was a sheer frustration for the players, manager and for the fans. Chelsea needed reaction in the 2nd half as we all knew we had to kill the game and get the crucial 3 points in our bag. But the start of the 2nd half was again dominated by Lille and it was hard for the blues to get the possession back. 

Since the game was slipping out from our hands it was time when Lampard decided to swap Reece James with the CHOsen one. Odoi came off the bench at 67th minute and the substitution worked as a wonder. In 77th minute Odoi provided a classy lofted pass to Willian who made sure that the ball finishes at the back of the net. The finishing was top class and surely sealed the game off.

There were some individual errors from Kepa and Tomori at the final minutes of the game which nearly costed us a goal but was being nicely tackled by our Spanish No.1.
The game ended as a win for us but still it showed that there were scopes of improvement in certain moments of the play. Defending looked a bit shaky at times and the finishing in the final third should have been more clinical. Nevertheless it was a first European victory for this new Chelsea side and for Frank Lampard as well whose tactical awareness surely got us the game. But we have to see how he assesses the flaws and makes improvement in the upcoming fixtures for the blues.
