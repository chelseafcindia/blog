This Sunday, we get to watch Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea side face an in-form Burnley who have managed to put an end to last season's champions Liverpool's 68 game unbeaten home streak.

It will be really interesting to see what Thomas Tuchel does after finally getting fair amount of time to analyse his players and the firepower available on the bench unlike our last game where Tuchel was in charge just one day after his appointment. The Blues look ready to face Burnley after putting a dominating performance against Wolves by keeping 78.9% possession and making 832 passes only allowing Wolves to take 4 shots while none of them were on target. Whereas, The Clarets are in red hot form with a 3 games winning streak after winning 3-2 against Aston Villa that too after being down 1-2 in the 68th minute. They will be looking to make it 4 wins in a row against the Blues.

# Squad

Thomas Tuchel confirmed that N'golo Kante is back in training with the squad but it remains unclear whether he’ll be starting against Burnley or not. We can expect players like Mount, Reece James and Zouma to be back in the squad once again as Tuchel made it pretty clear that his lineup against Wolves was formed off of more experienced players as he didn’t get enough time with his side before the game and he plans to use the young players going forward. We can expect to see more of Callum Hudson Odoi in the starting 11.

# Predicted XI

Although Thomas Tuchel is known to be a tactical genius and known for being tricky with his tactics and formations, Chelsea are expected to play 3-4-2-1 and utilise the wing backs once again. We previously saw Callum Hudson Odoi and Pulisic play as Wing backs after Pulisic was subbed on for Chilwell and we will probably be seeing more of that. We could potentially the Blues shift to a 3-4-1-2 or a 4-2-2-2 depending upon whether Tuchel plays Abraham in attack with Werner. It will be interesting to see our midfield partnership and would be interesting to see if Mount will be starting. 

# Current Form

## Burnley: L-L-W-W-W

Burnley haven’t looked back since losing to Manchester United and West Ham. They’ve managed to put an end to Liverpool’s 68 game unbeaten run at Anfield and continued their red hot form by beating Fulham 3-0 and Aston Villa 3-2. Sean Dyche's men will be looking to make it 4 in a row against Chelsea as they currently sit at 15th in the Premier League table with 19 games played. A win against Chelsea means that they’d be up to 13th place with a gap of 2 points over Wolves and Crystal Palace.

## Chelsea: W-W-L-W-D

Chelsea on the other hand are coming with a draw from their previous game with new head coach Thomas Tuchel. The German tactician will surely be hungry for a win at home to secure the 3 points. Chelsea will be returning to action against Burnley after putting up a dominating performance against Wolves and will be looking to get back to their winning ways. Will Chelsea finally turn things around or will Tuchel need more time to settle in the Premier League? Only time will tell.
