## Memories at Merseyside

Goodison Park has always been a tricky venue for Chelsea, but still there are some memorable games over past 15 years and here are couple of them:

### Everton 2-3 Chelsea, December 2006

Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea came from behind as many as three times to seal all 3 points at Goodison Park during 2006-07 season. The Toffees took a lead through Arteta penalty, but it was cancelled by brilliant freekick from Michael Ballack. Later Joseph Yobo restored the lead for the home side, during the last 10 minutes of the game, our Current Manager Frank Lampard, who was captain for that game, scored a long-range curler, and Didier Drogba netted an amazing winner, a volley outside the box. 

### Everton 3-6 Chelsea, August 2014

Another memorable game for Jose Mourinho, during 2014-15 season in his 2nd spell, a complete rejuvenated and a champion stuff from Chelsea. 6 goals in Merseyside which was one of the most memorable games during the decade. Within 5 minutes Chelsea scored 2 goals, thanks to Ivanovic and   Costa. Kevin Mirallas reduced the deficit at halftime and bought Toffees back to the game.
From 69th minute to 77th minute, in gap of 8 minutes, both teams produced 5 goals where Chelsea had 3 and Everton 2 goals, despite giving a strong fightback, Everton could not find an equaliser , as the scoreboard in 7 mins were 1-3,2-3,2-4,3-4,3-5. An own goal from Coleman, outside the box goal from Matic and Chip from Ramires, ensured Chelsea were in the driving seat, as former Chelsea player Samuel Eto’o scored a header after coming as sub. In the 90th minute a beautiful backheel assist from Mikel, and Diego Costa rounding the keeper, ensured us a memorable win at Goodison Park.
