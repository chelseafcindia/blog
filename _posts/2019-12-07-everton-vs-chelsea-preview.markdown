## Memories at Merseyside

Goodison Park has always been a tricky venue for Chelsea, but still, there are some memorable games over the past 15 years and here is a couple of them:

### Everton 2-3 Chelsea, December 2006

Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea came from behind as many as three times to seal the win at Goodison Park during the 2006-07 season. The Toffees took the lead through Arteta's penalty, but it was cancelled out by a brilliant freekick from Michael Ballack. Later, Joseph Yobo restored the lead for the home side. In the last 10 minutes of the game, our Current manager Frank Lampard, who was captaining the game, scored a long-range curler, and Didier Drogba netted an amazing winner later, a volley outside the box.

### Everton 3-6 Chelsea, August 2014

Another memorable game for Jose Mourinho during the 2014-15 season, a complete rejuvenated and champion stuff from Chelsea. 6 goals at Merseyside, which was one of the most memorable games during the decade. Within 5 minutes Chelsea scored 2 goals, thanks to  Costa and Ivanovic. Kevin Mirallas reduced the deficit at halftime and kept Toffees in the game. From 69th minute to 77th minute, in a gap of 8 minutes, both teams produced 5 goals, where Chelsea had 3 and Everton netted 2 goals. Despite giving a strong fightback, Everton could not find an equaliser. In the 90th minute, a beautiful team goal ensured us a memorable night at Goodison Park.
