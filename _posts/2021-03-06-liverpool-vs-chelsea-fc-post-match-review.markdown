An Important battle for 3 points ends in favour of Chelsea as they manage to beat reigning champions Liverpool 1-0 at their home.

This match was one of the difficult fixtures Chelsea had to face in their race to claim a UCL spot. Winning this important fixture means one less side to worry about for Tuchelâ€™s men. This match has also put Chelsea in 4th place with West Ham and Everton just a couple of points behind with 1 game in hand.

## Key Talking Points

### Chelsea FC

* This is Chelsea's 10th unbeaten game under Tuchel.
* Werner had his goal disallowed by VAR but he certainly has started to look better and better every game.
* Mason Mount proves yet again why he's one of our integral players with a brilliant goal.
* Azpilicueta, Christensen and Rudiger's partnership kept yet another Clean Sheet.
* Kante seems to have gotten himself back in the lineup as he started ahead of Kovacic.
* Not much was seen of Havertz as he was brought into the game in added minutes of the second half.
* Chilwell has provided much needed competition to Alonso for the LWB spot as he started in place of the Spaniard once again. 

## Player Ratings

**Starting XI:** Mendy (7), Azpilicueta (7), Christensen(7), Rudiger(6), Reece James(6), Chilwell (7), Kante (6), Jorginho (6), **Mount(8)**, Ziyech (5), Werner (8)

**Substitutes:** Pulisic (7), Kovacic (6), Havertz (5)

## Most Valuable Player

Mason Mount put up yet another stellar display proving every critic wrong. His goal was crucial to seal the 3 points in a tough fixture and as always, he was simply amazing. His dribbles into the oppositionâ€™s half and defensive work rate proved why heâ€™s one of our undoubted starters.

A win against the reigning champions will surely be something the Blues will look to gain motivation from, as they get ready to face Everton in their next home game in the Premier League.
