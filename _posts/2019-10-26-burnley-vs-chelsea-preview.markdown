Frank Lampard’s side will still be without Ross Barkley, N'Golo Kante, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen when they head to Burnley.

## Expected Line-up for Chelsea

Chelsea are expected to play in a 4-3-3 formation against Newcastle tonight. Lampard is left with limited options and likely to play out the game with a similar line-up that he fielded in Amsterdam. This is the team we can expect for tonight’s match:

## Players to Watch Out For

**Pulisic:** During our recent trip to Ajax, and in newcastle match, he made an amazing impact by coming as a sub, as he assisted Michy Batshuayi a late winner at Amsterdam Arena.

**Batshuayi:** Known for scoring crucial goals, he continued the same against Ajax.

Apart from them we have our academy prospects, Tomori, Mount, Abraham and Hudson Odoi with string of good performances this season under Frank Lampard.

## Memories for Frank Lampard at Turf Moor

During our 2009-10 title winning campaign, Chelsea registered a crucial 2-1 win at Turf Moor, our current manager Frank Lampard played for entire 90 minutes, and assisted John Terry for 82nd minute winning goal from the corner.

Our current U15 Coaching Staff Ashley Cole, Technical Academy Coach Joe Cole and Technical and Performance Advisor Petr Cech also started that game alongside Frank Lampard.

## Last Visit to Turf Moor

During our last visit at Turf Moor, Chelsea were victorious with the score line of 4-0. Morata, Willian, Barkley and Loftus-Cheek were all on target in that game, as it extended unbeaten run for Sarri.
